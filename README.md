<h2>Peta</h2>

The name Peta came out of PHPMeta. Itâ€™s basicly written in PHP with the use of smarty (template/.tpl-files) and dojo (Javascript). The idea behind this project is to avoid redundant rewrites. A maingoal is a good structure, where the administrator of a system could change things as he need, with a minimal work.

<h3>Status</h3>
Pluginsystem is working so far. There is a lot to improve, as example flexible menu, diffrent manipulatings in admin-objects, some bugfixes etc.
But by proof of concept, it works well. Because of this, there is a livedemo too.
<h4>Demo</h4>
The livedemo is foundable here: http://dev.thoeni.me/peta/index.php . When you test it, pls give a feedback.
